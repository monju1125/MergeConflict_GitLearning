Merge Conflict

Merge conflicts occur during the merging process when Git is unable to automatically 
resolve differences between source code in two commits. This situation typically arises 
when multiple developers work on separate branches and attempt to merge their changes 
into a common branch, leading to conflicting edits that require manual resolution.

Definition of Merge Conflict: A merge conflict is an event that takes place 
when Git cannot automatically resolve differences in the source code between two commits,
 often due to concurrent changes made by different developers.

Merging Process: Developers work on isolated branches and later merge their changes
into a single branch. Git's merge command combines these branches but may encounter 
conflicts if changes overlap or diverge. Merge conflicts occur during the merging process 
when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences between source code in two commits. 
This situation typically arises when multiple developers work on separate branches and

Types of Merge Conflict:
Git can automatically merge changes only if the commits are on different
 lines or branches. If at any moment you diverge from the process,
 different lines of source code may lead to merge conflicts. 
There are two main types of merge conflicts:

Pending Changes: During the merge process, if there are changes in 
the working area or directory that are moved to the stage area, 
the merge will fail due to pending changes. For instance, 
if you modify changes and plan to commit but decide to merge first,
 the merge will fail due to pending changes. You must resolve these changes before proceeding with the merge.

Conflict During Merge: If conflicts arise during the merge process, it indicates
 a conflict between your local branch and the branch being merged.
 Git attempts to resolve differences in the source code automatically, 
but if it cannot, manual intervention is required to resolve the conflicts.
